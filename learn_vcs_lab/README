          Basic compile and simulation flow

        file structure as following:
          dut.v           # a simple behavior model, react with stimulus from testbench
          tb.sv           # a simple test bench to drive stimulus to dut (design-under-test)

        Makefile use target
          make            # run compile + simulation
          make comp       # run compile only
          make sim        # run simulation only
          make clean      # remove all generated files except log file
          make cleanall   # remove all generated files

          Add option, use +testdata=... to control testcase.

        file structure as following:
          dut.v           # a simple behavior model, react with stimulus from testbench
          tb.sv           # a simple test bench to drive stimulus to dut (design-under-test)
          src.f           # filelist contain all source files
          Makefile        # control VCS simulator

        Makefile use target
          make            # run compile + simulation
          make comp       # run compile only
          make sim        # run simulation only
          make clean      # remove all generated files except log file
          make cleanall   # remove all generated files

        Topic:
          Demo how to run multiple testcase simulation with one compile database.
            1) create 'comp_dir' and run compile in this directory.
            2) create 'sim_dir' for later simulation.
            3) create 'sim1' directory under 'sim_dir' and link needed files from 'comp_dir'.
            4) run 1st testcase simulation in background and redirect stdout/stderr to term.log file.
            5) repeat step 2-4 for 2nd testcase simulation in 'sim2' directory under 'sim_dir'.
          
        Note:
          1) The files needed for simulation are 'simv' executable and 'simv.daidir' directory.
          2) sim1 and sim2 can be run simultaneously.

        file structure as following:
          dut.v           # a simple behavior model, react with stimulus from testbench
          tb.sv           # a simple test bench to drive stimulus to dut (design-under-test)
          src.f           # filelist contain all source files
          Makefile        # control VCS simulator

        Makefile use target
          make            # run compile + simulation
          make comp       # run compile only
          make sim1       # run 1st testcase simulation only
          make sim2       # run 2nd testcase simulation only
          make clean      # remove all generated files except log file
          make cleanall   # remove all generated files
