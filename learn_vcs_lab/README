        file structure as following:

          tb.sv           # a simple test bench to drive stimulus to dut (design-under-test)

          make sim        # run simulation only
          make clean      # remove all generated files except log file
          make cleanall   # remove all generated files

          Add option, use +testdata=... to control testcase.

        file structure as following:
          dut.v           # a simple behavior model, react with stimulus from testbench
          tb.sv           # a simple test bench to drive stimulus to dut (design-under-test)
          src.f           # filelist contain all source files
          Makefile        # control VCS simulator

        Makefile use target
          make            # run compile + simulation
          make comp       # run compile only
          make sim        # run simulation only
          make clean      # remove all generated files except log file
          make cleanall   # remove all generated files

Lab03 : 
        Topic:
          Demo how to run multiple testcase simulation with one compile database.
            1) create 'comp_dir' and run compile in this directory.
            2) create 'sim_dir' for later simulation.
            3) create 'sim1' directory under 'sim_dir' and link needed files from 'comp_dir'.
            4) run 1st testcase simulation in background and redirect stdout/stderr to term.log file.
            5) repeat step 2-4 for 2nd testcase simulation in 'sim2' directory under 'sim_dir'.
          
        Note:
          1) The files needed for simulation are 'simv' executable and 'simv.daidir' directory.
          2) sim1 and sim2 can be run simultaneously.

        file structure as following:
          dut.v           # a simple behavior model, react with stimulus from testbench
          tb.sv           # a simple test bench to drive stimulus to dut (design-under-test)
          src.f           # filelist contain all source files
          Makefile        # control VCS simulator

        Makefile use target
          make            # run compile + simulation
          make comp       # run compile only
          make sim1       # run 1st testcase simulation only
          make sim2       # run 2nd testcase simulation only
          make clean      # remove all generated files except log file
          make cleanall   # remove all generated files

Lab04 : 
        Topic:
          Demo how to collect coverage, generate coverage report and review coverage report.
            1) create 'comp_dir' and run compile in this directory.
            2) create 'sim_dir' for later simulation.
            3) create 'sim1' directory under 'sim_dir' and link needed files from 'comp_dir'.
            4) run 1st testcase simulation in background and redirect stdout/stderr to term.log file.
            5) repeat step 2-4 for 2nd testcase simulation in 'sim2' directory under 'sim_dir'.
            6) wait a while to confirm sim1 and sim2 simulation finished.
            ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          Additional step:
            7) generate coverage report from coverage database (simv.vdb), use firefox to open report.

        Note
          1) Recommanded steps:
                make            #
                                # wait a while to confirm sim1 and sim2 simulation finished
                make covrpt     # generate coverage report and use firefox to open report

          2) Then to raise the coverage score, you can run following steps:
                make sim3       #
                                # wait a while to confirm sim3 simulation finished
                make covrpt     # generate new coverage report

        file structure as following:
          dut.v           # a simple behavior model, react with stimulus from testbench
          tb.sv           # a simple test bench to drive stimulus to dut (design-under-test)
          src.f           # filelist contain all source files
          Makefile        # control VCS simulator

        Makefile use target
          make            # run compile + simulation (sim1 and sim2 as Lab03)
          make comp       # run compile only
          make sim1       # run 1st testcase simulation only
          make sim2       # run 2nd testcase simulation only
          make sim3       # run 3nd testcase simulation only
          make covrpt     # generate coverage report and use firefox to open report
          make clean      # remove all generated files except log file
          make cleanall   # remove all generated files

                make verdi

        file structure as following:

          tb.sv           # a simple test bench to drive stimulus to dut (design-under-test)
          src.f           # filelist contain all source files
          Makefile        # control VCS simulator and Verdi debug tool

        Makefile use target

          make comp       # run compile only
          make sim        # run simulation only
          make verdi      # open verdi debug tool
          make clean      # remove all generated files except log file
          make cleanall   # remove all generated files
